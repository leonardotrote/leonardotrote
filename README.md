# Hello there!👋

## About Me

I'm a Computer Engineering student at [Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio)](https://www.puc-rio.br/). Currently, I am interning in the Intelligence at [Globo](https://grupoglobo.globo.com/), where I'm gaining valuable experience in the field.

## Interests and Skills

- 🌱 I'm currently focusing on expanding my knowledge in PySpark and functional programming.
- 🔍 I have a keen interest in data visualization, and I'm skilled in Python and SQL.
- ⚙️ I enjoy using my programming skills to create mods for [The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim](https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/en/skyrim) with Papyrus scripting language. You may know me by my alias [glimfeathers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/158299623?tab=user+files) in the modding community!
